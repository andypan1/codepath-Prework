## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

YouTube:
    - Wide range of content from educational tutorials to vlogs and gaming

An app that I would like to build is a real time eSports app. Just like how their are apps like ESPN and Yahoo Sports that offer users real time notifications about their favorite sports and teams, I would like it to implement it into the eSports space. eSports has similiarties to physical sports, such as a variety of games to play/watch from and teams that feature the best gamers in the entire world. This app could also help expand eSports to the public, making it more accessible for the general population to get into eSports.
    
## Notes

While building the app, it took a bit to adjust to the UI. There is alot of buttons to click from and edit, so finding the ones that I need can take some time.
